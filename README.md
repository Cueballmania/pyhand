## PyHand
PyHand is a poker hand solver using the Catcus Kev/Paul Senzee method of manipulating bits with fast lookups

This project is made to create very explicit code that is easy to parse and understand.

This code will not run faster than the C++ implementation, but will hopefully create a more transparent solver.
